# CBF Programming Assignment

This code creates two recommender systems models and generates recommendations for a test set of users using both models. 
The first model builds an item vector for items using the tag information we have using TF-IDF formula. User vectors are generated by summing item vectors for the movies they elicit positive preference. 

The second model uses the same item vectors but when creating the user profile, we sum the item vectors with weights. The weights are defined by the rating the user provides for those movies.
